The answer is YES. Even though it isn’t mandatory to market your product daily, but it can help you to build an online presence on social media platforms. Digital marketing has given opportunities to various brands to reach a wide number of customers. This created an online race of marketers eager to sell products. Hence, First come first serve seems to be an effective mantra of successful resellers.

Whenever you connect a customer through your reselling business, customers need to know what to expect. Marketing is a bridge between you and consumers. It is the most important and effective way to reach your customers. Daily posting of products that you are reselling keeps customers updated and helps to build “Customer loyalty”. It is also useful to keep track of products that are in demand and gives customers insights into the product.

Let’s consider that you post about your product twice a week, giving you only 104 chances to engage with customers on another side if you post daily, you get 365 days to engage with your customers and take feedback for improvement.

But there are some KeyPoint's to remember while you try to create an online presence of your business via marketing. Probably the most important is, “Don’t try to bombard your customers with a lot”. Decide how much time you are willing to spend on your reselling business daily and plan your schedule for advertisements, emails, or other tools of marketing.

Another important thing is, “Keep an eye on the quality of your content”. Daily marketing can be very exhausting and you may run out of ideas or repeat the same patterns. This can create a bad image of your reselling business. Keep transparency with your customers. Don’t compromise quality for quantity. You can schedule a week prior about ideas to market your reselling products.

Decide a time of posting and give priority to quality. Daily marketing will help to increase your sales unless you don’t spam customers’ inboxes. ;)
