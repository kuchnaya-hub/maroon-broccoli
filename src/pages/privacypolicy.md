You can send a photo or video to friends or public using our App. When you use these services, It may be inevitably that you will share some information with us, in same time we are not responsible for any privacy concern which may arise after you share contents online So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information. That's why we've written this privacy policy. And it's why we've tried to write it in a way that's blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our privacy policy you can contact us (support@behtarads.com).\n\n## Information We Collect\n\nInformation given by you - When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a Behtar Ads account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username you'd like to go by, a password, an email address, a phone number, and your date of birth. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as profile pictures, a name, or other useful identifying information. Of course, you'll also provide us whatever information you send through the services, such as images and video to your friends. Keep in mind that the users you send images, video, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to Behtar Ads as well: Don't send messages or share content that you wouldn't want someone to save or share.\n\n## Information Tranferred\n\nUser data is handled securely, including transmitting it using modern cryptography (for example, over HTTPS).\n\n## Cookies Policy\n\nWhen you use our services, certain information may be stored locally on your mobile device using 'cookies' or similar technologies such as objects stored in our service's local storage on the device that you are using.
