    content: "## [](mailto:contact@hootout.com)END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT AND TERMS OF SERVICE\n\nWe’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we simply call the 'Terms') so that you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: these Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Behtar Ads. So please read them carefully.\n\nBy using the Services, you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don’t agree with them, then don’t use the Services.\n\nBehtar Ads is platform operated by KuchNaya TechnoLabs Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"KuchNaya TechnoLabs\" or \"Kuchnaya\" or\"Behtar Ads\" or\"we\" or\"us\" or\"our\"). KuchNaya TechnoLabs is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956. Behtar Ads is a product of KuchNaya TechnoLabs. The registered office of KuchNaya TechnoLabs is at 127, Ashar Enclave, Kolshet Road, Thane, Maharashtra ­ 400607, India. The company registration number is U72900MH2011PTC21360\n\n## Our Service\n\nNo one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.\n\nBy using the Services, you state that:\n\nYou are forming a binding contract with Behtar Ads\n\nYou will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations\n\nBehtar Ads reserves the right to modify this User Agreement and any Additional Terms, at any time without prior notice. Therefore, you should review this User Agreement and any Additional Terms on a regular and frequent basis.\n\nThe Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, YouTube will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third­party site. By using the Service, you expressly relieve YouTube from any and all liability arising from your use of any third­party website\n\nIf you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorised to grant all licences set out in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity.\n\n## &#xA;Rights we grant you\n\nBehtar Ads grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty­free, non­assignable, non­exclusive, revocable and non sub­licensable licence to access and use the Services. This licence is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Service's benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our ​Community ​Guidelines​, allow.\n\nAny software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.\n\nYou may not copy, modify, distribute, sell or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless applicable laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.\n\n## Rights you grant us\n\nMany of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a licence to use that content. How broad that licence is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.\n\nFor all Services other than Live, Local, and any other crowdsourced Service, you grant Behtar Ads a worldwide, royaltyfree, sublicensable, and transferable licence to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This licence is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.\n\nBecause Live, Local, and any other crowdsourced Services are public by nature and record matters of public interest, the licence you grant us for content submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to the rights you grant us in connection with other Services, you also grant us a perpetual licence to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly perform and publicly display content submitted to Live, Local or any other crowdsourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it's necessary, you also grant Behtar Ads and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and licence to use your name, likeness and voice solely in Live, Local or other crowdsourced content that you appear in, create, upload, post or send. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Behtar Ads or our business partners if your name, likeness or voice is conveyed through Live, Local or other crowdsourced Services.\n\nYou agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security related features of theService or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the Content therein\n\nFor more information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our privacy policy\n\nThough we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. However, you alone remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send or store through the Service.\n\nThe Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for Behtar Ads letting you access and use the Services, you agree that Hooout, its affiliates, and thirdparty partners may place advertising on the Services.\n\nWe always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.\n\n## The content of others\n\nMuch of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organisation that submitted it. Although Behtar Ads reserves the right to review all content that appears on the Services and to remove any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot – and do not – take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.\n\nThrough these Terms and our Community Guidelines , we make clear that we don't want the Services to be put to bad uses. But because we don't review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.\n\n## Privacy\n\nYour privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our privacy policy . We encourage you to give the privacy policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you agree that Behtar Ads can collect, use and transfer your information consistent with that policy.\n\n## Respecting other people’s rights\n\nBehtar Ads respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not upload, post, send or store content that:\n\nviolates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right; bullies, harasses or intimidates;\n\ndefames; or\n\nspams or solicits Behtar Ads's users.\n\nYou must also respect Behtar Ads’s rights. These Terms do not grant you any right to:\n\nuse branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos or any other materials used in our Services;\n\ncopy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as described in these Terms;\n\nuse the Services or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.\n\nUsing any other Trademark or protected content (in form of photo, audio or video) which you have no right to copy, use or distribute\n\nWe reserve the right to remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright\n\nIn short: you may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorised by these Terms. Nor may you help or enable anyone else to do so.\n\n## Copyright Policy\n\nBehtar Ads respect the Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if Behtar Ads becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user's account.\n\nIf you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, you may mail us or you may file a notice with our designated agent:\n\n'KuchNaya TechnoLabs, 127 - Ashar Enclave, Kolshet Road, Thane, Maharashtra - 400607, India.'\r\nEmail : support@behtarads.com\n\nIf you file a notice with our Copyright Agent,That means the notice must:\n\ncontain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner;\n\nidentify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;\n\nidentify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material;\n\nprovide your contact information, including your address, telephone number and an email address;\n\nprovide a personal statement that you have a belief in good faith that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and\n\nprovide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n\n## &#xD;&#xA;Safety\n\nWe try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that:\n\nYou will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.\n\nYou will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other user's information.\n\nYou will not use or develop any thirdparty applications that interact with the Services or other users' content or information without our written consent.\n\nYou will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, affect negatively or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Services.\n\nYou will not use or attempt to use another user’s account, username or password without their permission.\n\nYou will not solicit login credentials from another user.\n\nYou will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech or incitements to violence.\n\nYou will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.\n\nYou will not attempt to circumvent any contentfiltering techniques we employ or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorised to access.\n\nYou will not probe, scan or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.\n\nYou will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.\n\nWe also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way just to capture a content (any photo, video, audio or text) in Behtar Ads.\n\n## Your account\n\nYou are responsible for any activity that occurs in your account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account.\n\nBy using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:\n\nYou will not create more than one account for yourself.\rYou will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.\n\nYou will not buy, sell, rent or lease access to your Behtar Ads account, Live, Post, Message,Content , a Behtar Ads username or a friend link without our written permission.\n\nYou will not share your password.\n\nYou will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorised thirdparty applications or clients.\n\nIf you think that someone has gained access to your account, please reach out immediately to by mail at support@behtarads.com\n\n## &#xD;&#xA;User Content\n\nDefinition “ User Content ” means any content that Users upload, post or transmit (collectively, “ Post ”) to or through the Service including, without limitation, any text, photographs, User Videos or sound recordings and the musical works embodied therein, Broadcast Content, and any other works subject to protection under the laws of the country where our company resides or any other jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, and excludes any and all Company Content (including, without limitation, any SR Samples incorporated into the Company Videos).\n\nScreening User Content The Company offers Users the ability to submit User Content to or transmit through the Service. The Company does not pre-screen any User Content, but reserves the right to remove, disallow, block or delete any User Content in its sole discretion. In addition, we have the right – but not the obligation – in our sole discretion to remove, disallow, block or delete any User Content (i) that we consider to violate this EULA, applicable law or otherwise constitute Objectionable Content (defined in Section 5.i below); or (ii) in response to complaints from other Users or licensors of any Company Content, with or without notice and without any liability to you. As a result, we recommend that you save copies of any User Videos that you Post to the Service on your personal device(s) in the event that you want to ensure that you have permanent access to copies of such User Videos. The Company does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness or quality of any User Content, and under no circumstances will the Company be liable in any way for any User Content.\n\nIntellectual Property Rights . SUBJECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS IN ANY PREEXISTING CONTENT INCLUDED WITHIN YOUR USER CONTENT, INCLUDING COMPANY CONTENT, YOU RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE IN YOUR USER CONTENT AND SUBMITTING YOUR USER CONTENT TO THE SERVICE DOES NOT TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF YOUR RIGHTS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NO USER VIDEO WILL BE CONSIDERED TO BE A SEPARATE COPYRIGHTABLE WORK AND ALL RIGHTS IN EACH USER VIDEO WILL REMAIN WITH THE OWNERS OF THE CONTENT USED TO CREATE SUCH USER VIDEO.\n\nLicenses to User Content . You hereby grant the Company an unrestricted, assignable, sublicensable, revocable, royalty-free license throughout the universe to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, communicate to the public, publicly perform (including by means of digital audio transmissions and on a through-to-the-audience basis), make available, create derivative works from, retransmit from External Sites (except with respect to Broadcast Content), and otherwise exploit and use (collectively, “ Use ”) all User Content you Post to or through the Service by any means and through any media and formats now known or hereafter developed, for the purposes of (i) advertising, marketing, and promoting the Company and the Service; (ii) displaying and sharing your User Content to other Users of the Service; (iii) providing the Service as authorized by this EULA; and (iv) sublicensing Editors the appropriate rights to enable them to create Collaborative UGVs that incorporate any of your User Content as permitted by this EULA. If you terminate this EULA or remove any of your User Content from the Service after it has been included within a Collaborative UGV, then your license grant with respect to your User Content included within such Collaborative UGV is perpetual and irrevocable. You further grant the Company a royalty-free license to use your user name, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your User Content. You must not post any User Content on or through the Service or transmit to the Company any User Content that you consider to be confidential or proprietary. Any User Content posted by you to or through the Service or transmitted to the Company will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary, and treated as such by the Company, and may be used by the Company in accordance with this EULA without notice to you and without any liability to the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the preceding sentences of this Section include, but are not limited to, the right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly perform and communicate to the public sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting the Company the right to Use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner ( e.g. , a record label), a musical work copyright owner ( e.g. , a music publisher), a performing rights organization ( e.g. , ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.) (a “ PRO ”), a sound recording PRO ( e.g. , SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved in the creation of User Content.\n\nYou Must Have Rights to the Content You Post . You must not Post any User Content to the Service if you are not the copyright owner of or are not fully authorized to grant rights in all of the elements of the User Content you intend to Post to the Service. In addition, if you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not Post such sound recordings to the Service unless you have all necessary rights, authorizations, and permissions with respect to such embedded musical works that grant you sufficient rights to grant the licenses to the Company under these Terms. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the User Content Posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in these Terms; (ii) the Posting and Use of your User Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights, or any other rights of any person, including, but not limited to, the rights of any person visible in any of your User Content; (iii) the Posting of your User Content on the Service will not require us to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties; and (iv) the Posting of your User Content on the Service does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay all monies owing to any person as a result of Posting your User Content on the Service.\n\nSpecific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists . If you are a composer or author of a musical work and are affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license you grant through this EULA to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in this EULA or have such music publisher enter into this Agreement with us. Just because you authored a musical work ( e.g. , wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant us the licenses in this EULA. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service is in compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Service that may be claimed by your label.\n\nThrough-To-The-Audience Rights . All of the rights you grant in this EULA are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of External Sites will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content Posted or Used on such External Sites via the Service.\n\nWaiver of Rights to User Content . By Posting User Content to or through the Service, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or with respect to any User Content you Post to or through the Service.\n\nObjectionable Content . You are not permitted to and agree not to Post any User Content to the Service that is or could be interpreted to be (i) abusive, bullying, defamatory, harassing, harmful, hateful, inaccurate, infringing, libelous, objectionable, obscene, offensive, pornographic, shocking, threatening, unlawful, violent, or vulgar, (ii) promoting any product, good or service, or bigotry, discrimination, hatred, intolerance, racism, or inciting violence (including suicide), or (iii) with respect to SR Samples (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the musical works embodied therein), making a political message for or against any person, party, political belief or issue, of a religious nature, or harshly critical of any SR Samples, the copyright owner(s) thereof, or any author, contributor or royalty participant of an SR Sample, in each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section, as the Company may determine in its sole and absolute discretion (collectively, “ Objectionable Content ”). The Posting of any Objectionable Content may subject you to third party claims and none of the rights granted to you in this EULA may be raised as a defense against any third party claims arising from your Posting of Objectionable Content. You also agree not to use the Service for illegal or unlawful purposes, including, without limitation, to stalk any other User. If you encounter any Objectionable Content on the Service, then please immediately email the Company at legal@musical.ly or inform us through the functionality offered on the Service. You acknowledge and agree that the Company provides you the right to report Objectionable Content as a courtesy, and the Company has no obligation to remove or take any other action with respect to any Objectionable Content on the Service that you report to us. The Company may terminate, suspend, warn or take other appropriate actions against Users for Posting Objectionable Content to the Service, including, but not limited to, the removal of all User Content uploaded to the Service by a User.\n\nConsent to Use of Data . You understand and agree that the Company may collect and use technical data and related information, including, but not limited to, data from audio files resident on your device (e.g., we may scan sound recordings for metadata), your device’s UDID, and other technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services, such as the Audible Magic content identification feature, to you related to the Service.\n\nEndorsements . Notwithstanding any other provision of this EULA, you represent and warrant that you will comply with all laws and regulations regarding endorsements or testimonials made by you in any User Content, including that you will (i) make only accurate statements that represent your genuine experience with any product, good or service and (ii) make all required disclosures pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission’s (“ FTC ”) Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, as such Guides may be amended from time-to-time by the Federal Trade Commission. Follow this link for further information on complying with the FTC’s guidance: https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/one-stops/advertisement-endorsements/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf .\n\nNo Liability . For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will not be liable for any unauthorized use of User Content by any User.\n\n## Purchases and payments\n\nWe may offer various virtual goods and services (all of which we call 'Virtual Products') that you can purchase and use through the Services. You don't own these Virtual Products; instead you buy a limited revocable licence to use them. You'll always be shown the price for Virtual Product before you complete a purchase. But Behtar Ads does not handle payments or payment processing for any purchases; those are handled by thirdparty payment providers or service providers (such as Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store, among others). Some thirdparty service providers may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. Please check the thirdparty service provider's relevant terms for details.\n\nSubject to any applicable additional terms and conditions, all purchases are final and nonrefundable. And because our performance begins once you tap “Buy” and we give you immediate access to your purchase, you waive any right you may have under EU or other local law to cancel your purchase once it has been completed or to get a refund. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT Behtar Ads IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON.\n\nSome of the Virtual Products we offer are for onetime use only, while others are for repeated use. But please note that 'repeated' does not mean 'forever.' We may change, modify or eliminate Virtual Products at any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will bear no liability to you or any third party if we do so. If we suspend or terminate your account, you will lose any Products you purchased through the Services.\n\nIt’s your sole responsibility to manage your purchases. If you are under 18 (or younger than the age of legal majority in your place of residence), you must obtain your parent's or guardian's consent before making any purchases.\n\nBehtar Ads does not transmit any funds and is not a moneyservices business. To the extent such functionality is made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other thirdparty service, subject to that third party's separate terms of use.\n\n## Data charges and mobile phones\n\nYou are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text messaging and data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.\n\nIf you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Behtar Ads account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you.\n\n## Thirdparty services\n\nIf you use a service, feature or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we offer jointly with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective party’s relationship with you. Behtar Ads is not responsible or liable for those third party’s terms or actions taken under the third party’s terms.\n\n## Modifying the services and termination\n\nWe’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. This means that we may add or remove features, products or functionalities and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time and, when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.\n\nThough we hope you remain a lifelong Behtar Ads user, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.\n\nBehtar Ads may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, and without advance notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.\n\n## Indemnity\n\nYou agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Behtar Ads, our directors, officers, employees and affiliates from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) due to, arising out of or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nWe try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.\n\nTHE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THOUGH Behtar Ads ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR FREE OR TIMELY; (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY Behtar Ads CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.\n\n## Limitation of liability\n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, Behtar Ads AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORISED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT OR POSTS, EVEN IF Behtar Ads HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL Behtar Ads’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID Behtar Ads, IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.\n\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n## Arbitration, class waiver and jury waiver\n\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH Behtar Ads AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.\n\n**Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** All claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Behtar Ads are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.\n\n**Additional rules for nonappearance arbitration.** If nonappearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\n\n**Authority of the arbitrator.** The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Behtar Ads. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any nonmonetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Behtar Ads.\n\n\\*\\*Waiver of jury trial. \\*\\*YOU AND Behtar Ads WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Behtar Ads are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Behtar Ads over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND Behtar Ads WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and instead elect to have the dispute resolved by a judge.\n\n**Waiver of class or consolidated actions**. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR BE CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration: instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set out in section ‘Governing Laws and Jurisdiction’.\n\n\\*\\*Confidentiality. \\*\\*No part of the procedures will be open to the public or the media. All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, under a court order or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the above, no party will be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information needed to enforce this arbitration agreement, to enforce an arbitration award or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.\n\n\\*\\*Right to waive. \\*\\*Any rights and limitations set out in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.\n\n\\*\\*Optout. \\*\\*You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Behtar Ads can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Behtar Ads in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement.
